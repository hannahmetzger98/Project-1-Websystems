<h1> Hannah Metzger </h1>
<h2> Painter </h2>
<h3 id="para1"> Born in 1998, Hannah Metzger grew up North of Chicago, IL. The elder of
a pair of sisters, she would make mud pies and fairy homes in her backyard. </h3>
<h4 id="para2"> She found truth and knowledge in the canvas.
Currently finishing her degree in Studio Art and Computer Science, she is living
in Nashville, TN. Stretched across canvas are both massive and tiny self-portraits,
filled with the colors of home. Influenced by the masters of
the 20th and 21st centuries, she draws her inspiration from nature
and the light. There is much more than silent characters, the multiples
reveal themselves as ephemeral and sensual, through juxtaposition and
challenging the notion of reality.</h4>
